# Basketball Team Stats Tool

This program assigns players to basketball teams and displays their stats.

It uses team and player data stored in an external file and allows the user to view the following data for each team:
- Team name
- Number of players
- Names of players
- Names of guardians
- Number of experienced and inexperienced players
- Average height for players on a team

Users can call main_menu() from `app.py`, and the program will read and convert `TEAMS` and `PLAYERS` data from `constants.py` before displaying a main menu.
